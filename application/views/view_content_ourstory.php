			Sahteyn is a word you will often hear in a Lebanese home; loosely translated it means “twice your health”,
			a form of welcome to join a family and share delicious food.
			And this is some of the most exquisite food in the world too, as Lebanese cuisine is both generous and abundant.
		    <br>We serve the best Mediterranean food as well as we are Oklahoma's
			one and only one pita bread bakery.
			Come and get your healthy hump filled at shawkats.</p>
